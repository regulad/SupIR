# ![SupIR Icon](app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.webp) SupIR

SupIR is an open-source general-purpose IR blaster for Android using the [irdb](https://github.com/probonopd/irdb) database. Inspired by the now-abandoned [AndroidInfraRed](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed), SupIR puts the power of a Universal Remote or a Flipper Zero in your pocket.

SupIR requires an Android phone with an IR blaster. If your phone does not have an IR blaster, unfortunately, you are out of luck. Consider finding a device like a Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and bringing it up to date with LineageOS.

## 2024-2025 Weekend Project #1

Hi, I'm Parker, and I'm a senior in High School. This year, I'm going to be making a project once every couple of weekends to keep my skills sharp and to learn new things. I'm going to be documenting my progress on this GitHub page, so I hope you stick around to see what I make!

This project was born when one of my friends in Econ asked if I could turn off the projector. I actually used to keep a Universal remote in my backpack for TVs in hotel rooms I didn't have the remote for, but I ended up taking it out of my backpack because it was too bulky. I thought it would be cool to have a device like a Flipper Zero in my backpack, but I'm broke and didn't want to buy one of those. I did, however, have a pile of old Android phones, some of which had IR blasters. 16 hours of work later, I had SupIR.

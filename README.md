# SupIR

SupIR is an open-source general-purpose IR blaster for Android using the [irdb](https://github.com/probonopd/irdb) database. Inspired by the now-abandoned [AndroidInfraRed](https://github.com/OneButtonDeveloper/AndroidInfraRed), SupIR puts the power of a Universal Remote or a Flipper Zero in your pocket.

SupIR requires an Android phone with an IR blaster. If your phone does not have an IR blaster, unfortunately, you are out of luck. Consider finding a device like a Samsung Galaxy S4 and bringing it up to date with LineageOS.
